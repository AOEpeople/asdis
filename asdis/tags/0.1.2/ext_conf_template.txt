# cat=basic; type=options[Before Storing in cache (contentPostProc-all)=contentPostProc-all,Before outputting the content to the browser (contentPostProc-output)=contentPostProc-output]; label=Which Hook should be used: The "contentPostProc-output" hook is called before the page will be outputted to the browser. The result of replacing the assets will not be cached. But therefore you can replace much more assets than before storing the content within the cache. That is because of the fact, that some other extensions changing the output within this hook too and adds some additional assets to the output. The "contentPostProc-all" is used before the content is is stored within the cache. Be careful with using the "contentPostProc-output" hook since this is much more expensive for the site performance.
hook=contentPostProc-all
